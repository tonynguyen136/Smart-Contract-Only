# Smart-Contract-Only

Solidity Smart Contract Only
**Lottery**: 

Take note:
In this smart contract we can use random() function using abi.encodePacked it's called: **Pseudo-random**
with some parameters likc block.difficulty, block.timestamp...It is eccpected for the testing.

In fact, it may lead some potential security risks
so the idea is that we can use **random with off-chain data**, Chainlink is providing one of the best solutions
for communication between off-chain data to on-chain data.
